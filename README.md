# PredictingGeneticvariations
Classification of Genetic Mutations based Clinical text so as to predict their effects on Personalized Medicine <br>

### To run this code, you will need: 
- Numpy - Version: 1.14.3
- Pandas - Version: 0.22.0
- Seaborn - Version: 0.8.1
- Matplotlib - Version: 2.2.2
- NLTK, Regex, Sklearn, and lightgbm modules

### To execute the classifier: 
Download the repository and run the Genetic_Variations.py file.  
Change the path to the dataset as per your system!
The dataset is in the repository:
- Training Variants - Contains the description of the genetic mutations for training
- Training Text - Contains the clinical evidence to classify the mutations.
- Test variants - Contains the description of the genetic mutations for testing.
Test Text - Contains the clinical evidence to classify the mutations.
The sample submissions file holds the classification results.
